  <div class="anniversary-letter">

<p>If I were to describe a color, the redness or pinkness mixed with a hint of yellow that fills my heart as I walk towards the number 308. The increasing anticipation of familiarity and warmness as my silver key slides through the knob with a small click. Almost everyday for almost a whole year, how lucky am I? How lucky am I to be able to come in, through the door and meet with the most caring, loving, compassionate eyes, and the two arms that cast a spell to stop time and embrace me in the warmest blanket in space. My safe place and my handsome.</p>

<p>It has been officially two years since the text message "I told my dad you're my girlfriend". I remember so vividly the redness that covered my face as soon as I finished reading "my" and "girlfriend", never would I have thought I was going to have a boyfriend and your dad knowing before I did. And before you know it, all the car rides to rite aid, walking to school talking about life, studying and laughing like crazies for our final exams, all the tomatoes this year that would add up to the cost of a NORMAL persons' lifetime worth, all the Sunday breakfast we had, the Jewish church trips we tried out, the mafia movies we watched, all the friend birthdays and gatherings, the UFC and Vegas trip we had, all the Once Piece, Squid Game, and Dr.Stone episodes we have watched, zooming out and just seeing everything we have done, these are memories I treasure. I came knowing I wanted to give it my all and share my happiness with you, create beautiful memories and carry life in our hands.</p>

<p>The pinkness of the pepto bismol, the painful nights of shivers and restlessness that sickness caused a couple times. The demons that provoke us, the depression episodes during winter you had to overcome, and my anxiety that flares to the most extreme cases of distrust and wanting to run away from everything we held. These moments that put our love to test, the words that rung against my ears "I am a bad girlfriend", "why am I so emotional", "why am I so annoying". I never expected love to be so painful at times so confusing and emotional and unexpected when these feelings come up. But all the love and care, the faith you always had in us to push through everything even these hard moments showed me really that you are one of a kind. We have been through everything and the more and more I spend with you, the more I could feel so deeply. There is this constant fear in me, if my love grows and grows will I be able to survive if something falls apart? One thing is certain, I know I want to die knowing that I gave it my all.</p>

<p>The morning hint of yellow, with a clear mind pulls me back to the zoomed out world. I am here with you, my handsome, and enjoy one day at a time. Focus on us now and treasure all the youthfulness and new love we have, the times we went through the pain, we grew stronger and stronger together through those times. And here, right now I want to just stop and appreciate just how amazing you are. You are the perfect dream boyfriend anyone could ever dream to have and you are so special, you feel so deeply and are able to understand people so easily and you have a special gift in wrapping your mind around the most complicated topics in a simple way. The few hours that it takes you to study and get above mean on every test, is something that I grew accustomed to</p>

<p>You really are gifted handsome, and I am so so lucky to have crossed paths with you. From first working on the Stats 21 project together and during summer having all the discord calls. I learned and grew so much, from understanding and expressing my emotions, feeling more feminine in my skin, exploring my different hobbies in baking and cooking, how to forgive and be empathetic, all these things and most importantly freely being myself and being accepted.</p>

<p>Thank you for sticking through with me and showing me all the love and care in the world, for having faith even when times got hard, forgiving me for all the flares and bumps, for being the most loyal and buying me tomatoes in the world, and taking me out when you even though you still had to pay a lot for your car.</p>

<p>As the two arms pull back slowly and the color, the redness or pinkness mixed with a hint of yellow that fills my heart and I meet with the most caring, loving, compassionate eyes,</p>

<p>my handsome, you are someone I cherish so much and are so precious to the world, you have made me so incredibly happy over these 2 years and I can't wait to make many more memories.</p>
