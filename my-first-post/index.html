<p>This site is powered by Jekyll and built on the highly versatile Minimal Mistakes theme. I chose this combination for its flexibility, robust features, and excellent support for GitHub Pages. My aim is to create a clean, modern, and informative platform to showcase my academic journey, research, projects, and insights.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, I plan to populate this site with:</p>

<p>Details about my ongoing research in [Your Research Area].</p>

<p>Showcases of personal coding projects.</p>

<p>My publications, linking to relevant papers and preprints.</p>

<p>Regular blog posts on topics ranging from [Topic 1] to [Topic 2].</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates! This is just the beginning.</p>

<p>This is a sample post. You can delete or edit it later.</p>
