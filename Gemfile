# Add other plugins you use here, e.g.:
gem "jekyll-paginate"
gem "jekyll-sitemap"
gem "jekyll-gist"
gem "jekyll-feed"
gem "jekyll-include-cache"

# If you're building locally, you might need additional gems not included in github-pages:
# gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll", "~> 4.26" # This line is NOT needed with `remote_theme`
                                         # but useful if you want to fork the theme for heavy customization.

# To use academicons (for Google Scholar icon etc.)
gem "jekyll-scholar" # Minimal Mistakes might include its own academicons, but this is good to have.
