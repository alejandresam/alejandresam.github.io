gem "jekyll", "~> 4.3" # Jekyll version
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins # Required for GitHub Pages compatibility

# If you're building locally, you might need additional gems not included in github-pages:
# gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll", "~> 4.26" # This line is NOT needed with `remote_theme`
                                         # but useful if you want to fork the theme for heavy customization.

# To use academicons (for Google Scholar icon etc.)
gem "jekyll-scholar" # Minimal Mistakes might include its own academicons, but this is good to have.
