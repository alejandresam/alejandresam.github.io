// Minimal Mistakes can be thought of as creating a new file "_sass/minimal-mistakes.scss"
// that compiles the entire theme. You are creating your own main.scss to override.

// 1) Pick whatever skin you want
@import "minimal-mistakes/skins/mint";   // or “default”, “dark”, etc.

// 2) Pull in all core styles
@import "minimal-mistakes";

// 3) 👉 **NOW import your overrides**
@import "custom";          // looks for _sass/_custom.scss
