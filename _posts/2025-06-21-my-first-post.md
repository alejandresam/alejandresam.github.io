This site is powered by Jekyll and built on the highly versatile Minimal Mistakes theme. I chose this combination for its flexibility, robust features, and excellent support for GitHub Pages. My aim is to create a clean, modern, and informative platform to showcase my academic journey, research, projects, and insights.

In the coming weeks, I plan to populate this site with:

Details about my ongoing research in [Your Research Area].

Showcases of personal coding projects.

My publications, linking to relevant papers and preprints.

Regular blog posts on topics ranging from [Topic 1] to [Topic 2].

Stay tuned for more updates! This is just the beginning.
